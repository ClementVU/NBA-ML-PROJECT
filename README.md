# NBA Match Prediction Project

## Overview

This project, inspired by the [YouTube Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egTylm6C2is), aims to predict NBA match outcomes using machine learning techniques. The primary objective is to build a predictive model that can forecast the winner of NBA games based on historical data.



## Project Objectives

1. **Data Loading:** Load historical NBA match data into the project environment.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyze the dataset to understand its structure and characteristics.
3. **Feature Engineering:** Create relevant features for predicting match outcomes.
4. **Data Preprocessing:** Prepare the data for training machine learning models.
5. **Model Selection:** Choose appropriate machine learning models for match prediction.
6. **Model Training:** Train the selected models using historical data.
7. **Evaluation:** Assess the performance of the models using appropriate metrics.
8. **Prediction:** Use the trained models to predict the outcomes of upcoming NBA matches.
9. **Conclusion:** Summarize the predictive capabilities of the models and potential areas for improvement.

## Tools Used

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries Used:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
- **Machine Learning Models:** Decision Trees, Random Forest, Logistic Regression (or any other suitable models)
- **IDE:** Jupyter Notebook or any preferred Python IDE
